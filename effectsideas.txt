Abilities on death effects.

When someone dies you can do damage to all around it, or all in a line vertical or horizontal,  or both.

We can add health to certain enemies, certain directions.

Add / take away attack damage…

On death randomise all pieces on the board.. mega.

Rarity bonuses..
Gold always gets 2 abilities. 100%
Purple always one.. 100%
Blue sometimes one… 50% OR always has one but the strength is lower..

Maybe have them in a range, for example, blue is 1- 2 and purple+ is 2 - 4

Or whole board effects eg, all players swap positions. All take damage, or all heal for 1… etc..

Nice ideas..!!! !!
