# Board Game - Based on Vietnamese Chess

Prototype for a SocketIO board / character battle game (from 2021) with unlockable characters using packs etc.

Each square has an attack and defence value in this prototype for testing purposes.

The movement paths are not visible on the game but there are rules on movement.

To damage two enemies either move between two enemies, or move your players so you sandwich an enemy to damage them.

Below, the gif is showing a match against myself using two browser windows.
